# to compute various demographic scores
# Tyler, 5/6/19

# Added to 2019 VRDI Week 5 clustering project repo on 2019-7-22, from capy/tyler_stuff in gerrymandr
# Had to make some changes to make this work with Python 3.7:
#     -    print("string") instead of print "string"
#     -    "sets" module has been replaced by built-in set object
#     -    numpy.matmul wasn't working properly, replaced with np.dot
